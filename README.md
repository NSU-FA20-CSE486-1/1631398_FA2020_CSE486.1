## App Features

The app is designed for two distinct users- one is chef and another is customer. For both users, essential features are developed and integrated in the app. The features are explained below:

</br>


- #### Features in Chef's Account


1. Chefs can add food items to their kitchen/store. For adding an item, all they need is to fill up a form and submit. The form contains food name, description, price and an option to upload the picture of the particular food. After submit, the information of the item is stored in database.

3. Chefs are able to view customers' orders in their homepage. The orders are presented on a CardView in RecycleView. In the order, chef can see customer's name, address, contact number and type of order including the total quantity and price. After seeing the orders, they can either accept or reject according to their preference. When a chef accept an order, notification is sent to customer which states order accepted confirmation message.

## Data Management

For the management of the data, Firebase Cloud Firestore has been used which is a NoSQL database. Cloud Firestore is Firebaseâ€™s newest flagship database for mobile apps which is richer, faster, and more scalable than the Realtime Database.

Cloud Firestore stores data in documents arranged in collections. Simple data is stored in documents, which is easy and similar to the way data is stored in JSON. Complex, hierarchical data is conveniently organized at scale using subcollections within documents. Cloud Firestore requires less denormalization and data flattening.

For this app, no local storage has been used but it can be integrated later.

## Roadblocks

While working with the application, there were some roadblocks which slowed down the rate of work. However, the problems were solved gradually and were able to move forward. The roadblocks contains browsing images from mobile device and upload to firebase storage. The link of the image which is stored in the storage needs to be sent to cloud firestore. This took a lot of time and lastly it was solved using 'Glide' library. 

Second roadblock was to fetch information from cloud firestore and to display in the CardView. At first, the data was not shown displayed correctly. This occurred because some of the model constructors was not matching with the Adapter's function.

There was another problem which was the constant crashing of app during runtime. Later, the emulator was re-installed and then the problem was solved.
